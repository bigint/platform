4 - To add the bot to your Telegram group, go to ADD MEMBER and look for your bot with the user name you've given it and add it.

### How to get the CHAT ID

If the Telegram group is **public**, simply add @ to the beginning of the group name found in the link to join. Example: if the link is: t.me/chainjet the ID will be @chainjet.

For **private groups**, you must use the telegram bot, [RawDataBot](https://t.me/raw_data_bot). Search for that user in telegram and share the group invitation link. The bot will return a message with the ID, just copy it and paste in the corresponding field in your workflow.
