# Introduction

### Overview

ChainJet is a decentralized platform for building on-chain or off-chain task automations without having to code custom solutions. With ChainJet, users can integrate multiple services to automate all kinds of tasks.

ChainJet provides an extensive collection of well-tested modules that perform a particular task each (e.g., transferring a token) and can be connected to one another to define the steps the automation will follow.

### Why do I need web3 automation?

One of the best advantages of web3 protocols is that they can all interact with each other through their smart contracts. For example, on web2, if you want to connect your bank with a third-party service, you depend on your bank to give you access to their API and on a third party to build the integration.

The real power of web3 doesn't come from a single protocol, but from the interconnection of all of them. ChainJet empowers all users to create workflows that span multiple protocols in a simple, cost-efficient, and secure manner.

### How does it work?

Every automation on ChainJet is represented as a workflow. A workflow has a single trigger that specifies the condition that will start the execution and a set of steps to be performed when the trigger condition is satisfied.

A network of executor bots will constantly monitor for the triggers and initiate executing the steps defined in the workflow when the condition is met.
