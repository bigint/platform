# Introduction

### Overview

ChainJet is a no-code platform that enables entrepreneurs and communities to build web3 automations. The platform allows users to create on-chain or off-chain task automations using our +100 integrations.

ChainJet automations are built using workflows. Each workflow has a trigger and a set of actions that are executed when the trigger condition is met. Each trigger and action accept a set of inputs and provide a set of outputs, the outputs of each operation can be used as inputs for their following operations.

### Why do I need web3 automation?

One of the best advantages of web3 protocols is that they can all interact with each other through their smart contracts. For example, on web2, if you want to connect your bank with a third-party service, you depend on your bank to give you access to their API and on a third party to build the integration.

The real power of web3 doesn't come from a single protocol, but from the interconnection of all of them. ChainJet empowers all users to create workflows that span multiple protocols in a simple, cost-efficient, and secure manner.

### How does it work?

On ChainJet, every task automation is represented as a workflow. A workflow consists of a single trigger that defines the condition that will initiate its execution, and a series of steps to be performed once the trigger condition is met.
