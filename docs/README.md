# Introduction

### Overview

Welcome to ChainJet, the no-code platform that makes web3 automation simple and accessible to everyone. ChainJet allows users to create task automations by connecting together the +100 integrations available.

ChainJet enables you to create task automations through workflows. These workflows consist of a trigger and a series of actions. When the trigger conditions are met, all the actions are automatically executed. Each trigger and action accepts inputs and provides outputs, allowing you to pass information seamlessly between operations.

### What is an integration?

An integration is a single service or protocol supported by ChainJet. It enables users to automate tasks that involve the connected service. Users can access the most important features of the connected service through a set of triggers and actions. Triggers are API calls that tell ChainJet when new items are available in the connected service, while actions are API calls that allow ChainJet to perform specific tasks within the connected service.

For example, if a user connects its Lens Protocol profile to ChainJet, they might set up a trigger to watch for new posts on their Lens feed. When a new post is detected, the trigger would activate a set of actions, such as automatically sharing the post on another social media platform or sending a notification to a Discord channel.

In essence, ChainJet integrations provide a curated set of the most important features of a web2 or web3 service, allowing users to automate their workflows in a flexible and efficient manner. By connecting services together, users can build complex task automations that fit their specific needs without having to code custom solutions.
