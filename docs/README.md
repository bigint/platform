# Introduction

### Overview

Welcome to ChainJet, the no-code platform that makes web3 automation simple and accessible to everyone. ChainJet allows users to create task automations by connecting together the +100 integrations available.

ChainJet enables you to create task automations through workflows. These workflows consist of a trigger and a series of actions. When the trigger conditions are met, all the actions are automatically executed. Each trigger and action accepts inputs and provides outputs, allowing you to pass information seamlessly between operations.

### Why do I need web3 automation?

One of the best advantages of web3 protocols is that they can all interact with each other through their smart contracts. For example, on web2, if you want to connect your bank with a third-party service, you depend on your bank to give you access to their API and on a third party to build the integration.

The real power of web3 doesn't come from a single protocol, but from the interconnection of all of them. ChainJet empowers all users to create workflows that span multiple protocols in a simple, cost-efficient, and secure manner.

### How does it work?

On ChainJet, every task automation is represented as a workflow. A workflow consists of a single trigger that defines the condition that will initiate its execution, and a series of steps to be performed once the trigger condition is met.
